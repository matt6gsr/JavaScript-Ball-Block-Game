# BALL BLOCK GAME

I followed a tutorial on how to make this game to teach myself how to write a game using JavaScript. Having never built a anything like this before I was interested in the whole proccess. I tried putting my own stamp on the project by refactoring where possible and adding small features and additional sounds.

To play the move the paddle, use the LEFT and RIGHT keys on the keypad, the ball will start automatically. The rows of blocks increase with each level along with the speed of the ball. The game is over when either you lose all 3 lives or you reach the end break all the bricks on level 5. Good luck!
